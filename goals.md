my programming experience so far was not as fullfilling as i could have wished. it was similar to a late night assault when you try to fight back yet you are powerless. we worked in python and my biggest struggle was creating cycles and punctuation. other than that, i could say i was rather decent in my attempts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiqoaX7rON4
